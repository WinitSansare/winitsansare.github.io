Docker is a platform that simplifies building, running, and shipping applications using containers. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

## Why Docker?

- **Portability**: Containerized applications run the same regardless of the underlying host system.
- **Isolation**: Each container is isolated, making it easier to manage dependencies and security.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are lightweight and start quickly, requiring fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.

## Basic Concepts

- **Image**: A read-only template used to create containers. Images are built from a Dockerfile.
- **Container**: A running instance of an image, including the application and its environment.
- **Dockerfile**: A script containing instructions for building a Docker image.

## Example Workflow

1. Write a `Dockerfile` describing your application environment.
2. Build the image with `docker build -t myapp .`.
3. Run the container using `docker run myapp`.

Docker has become a foundational tool in modern DevOps workflows. Whether you're deploying microservices or experimenting locally, understanding Docker will help you streamline development and deployment processes.
